# eslint-config-21st

This package provides 21st digital's ESLint [Shareable Config](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) with support for Prettier. It is based on [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com).

## Install

1. If you don't already have a `package.json` file, create one with `npm init`.

2. Then we need to install everything needed by the config:

```bash
npx install-peerdeps --dev @21st-digital/eslint-config
```

3. You can see in your package.json there are now a big list of devDependencies.

4. Create a `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project's directory (it should live where package.json does). Your `.eslintrc` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": ["@21st-digital"]
}
```

Tip: You can alternatively put this object in your `package.json` under the property `"eslintConfig":`. This makes one less file in your project.

5. You can add two scripts to your package.json to lint and/or fix:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
},
```

6. Now you can manually lint your code by running `npm run lint` and fix all fixable issues with `npm run lint:fix`. You probably want your editor to do this though.

## VS Code

You probably want your editor to lint and fix for you. Here are the instructions for VS Code:

1. Install the [ESLint package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
2. Now we need to setup some VS Code settings via `Code/File` → `Preferences` → `Settings`. It's easier to enter these settings while editing the `settings.json` file, so click the Open (Open Settings) icon in the top right corner:

```js
// These are all my auto-save configs
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
// turn it off for JS and JSX, we will do this via eslint
"[javascript]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": false
},
"[javascriptreact]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": false
},
// show eslint icon at bottom toolbar
"eslint.alwaysShowStatus": true,
// tell the ESLint plugin to run on save
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll": true
},
// Optional BUT IMPORTANT: If you have the prettier extension enabled for other languages like CSS and HTML, turn it off for JS since we are doing it through Eslint already
"prettier.disableLanguages": ["javascript", "javascriptreact"],
```

After attempting to lint your file for the first time, you may need to click on 'ESLint' in the bottom right and select 'Allow Everywhere' in the alert window.

Finally you'll usually need to restart VS code. They say you don't need to, but it's never worked for me until I restart.
